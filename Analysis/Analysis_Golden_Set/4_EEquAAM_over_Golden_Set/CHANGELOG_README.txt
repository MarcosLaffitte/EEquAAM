*** Solution to Entry 1: canonicalizing every molecule smiles inside EEquAAM while building the reactants and products graphs just before reading these smiles with pysmiles. To do so, the python package RDKit was implemented, reading each smiles with it and printing back an "un-kekulized" smiles where aromatic rings are represented with lower-case element symbols instead of explicit single and double bonds. This change was only applied to EEquAAM and pysmiles has not shown any incompatibility with this method SO FAR. Nevertheless, the MappingTool.py remains unchanged, since applying this or similar methods / filters to the smiles before given them to the mappers (RXN, RDT and CHY), may produce symbols that the mappers are not able to handle.
